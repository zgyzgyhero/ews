## EWS Exchange Web Service Extend
Exchange Web Service client for golang,Base on `mhewedy/ews`

### Improvement:

* fixed some bug about `NTLM` (~~update `github.com/Azure/go-ntlmssp` package version~~ Change `github.com/Azure/go-ntlmssp` to `github.com/vadimi/go-http-ntlm/v2`,because `go-ntlmssp` has so many bugs....).
* fixed some service not support `HTTP1.1` ,but go will use `HTTP2.0` if our service URL is `HTTPS` (After `Go 1.6` ，See [THIS](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http)).
* Add support for email with Attachment.
* Using strategy like [ews-java-api](https://github.com/OfficeDev/ews-java-api) deal with email with attachment.which is save the mail content and subject,than save mail attachment,finally send the mail we saved.(Because _ews-java-api_ project comment said, see below)
```java
        // Bug E14:80316 -- If the message has attachments, save as a
        // draft (and add attachments) before sending.
```

### TODO:

- [ ]   Inline Attachment - like picture in email body.
- [ ]   Support html email body with inline attachment.
- [x]   Support Mail CC and BCC.

### usage:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/mhewedy/ews"
	"github.com/mhewedy/ews/ewsutil"
	"log"
)

func main() {

	c := ews.NewClient(
		"https://outlook.office365.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx",
		"email@exchangedomain",
		"password",
		&ews.Config{Dump: true, NTLM: false},
	)

	err := ewsutil.SendEmail(c,
		[]string{"mhewedy@gmail.com", "someone@else.com"},
		"An email subject",
		"The email body, as plain text",
	)

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("err>: ", err.Error())
	}

	fmt.Println("--- success ---")
}

```
> Note: if you are using an on-premises Exchange server (or even if you manage your servers at the cloud), you need to pass the username as `AD_DOMAINNAME\username` instead, for examle `MYCOMANY\mhewedy`.
